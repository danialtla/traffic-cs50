Traffic AI - CS50 AI Project

Introduction
Welcome to the Traffic AI project, part of the CS50 AI course.
This project aims to create an AI system to manage traffic signals efficiently, minimizing waiting time and reducing congestion. 
The AI uses machine learning techniques to optimize traffic flow in a simulated environment.

Features

Traffic Signal Control: AI manages traffic lights at intersections.
Real-Time Optimization: Continuously adjusts signals based on real-time traffic conditions.
Simulation Environment: Test the AI in a simulated city with various traffic scenarios.
Performance Metrics: Tracks key metrics such as average wait time, congestion levels, and throughput.
